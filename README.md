## SortAnalyser

Comparison of different sorting algorithms. Implemented in both Python and C++. View the graphs in `Plots` and `Bar Plots` folder. You can also view the `Results` folder for analysis of some other input sizes I ran.

You can play around with the different input sizes, algorithms, etc... in the `sortAnalyser.py` file.

**To run:**

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python sortAnalyser.py
```
